        **React State Management:**

        React offers multiple approaches documented in your guide:

        1. **Built-in Hooks** (useState, useReducer):
          - useState for simple local state
          - useReducer for more complex state logic with actions

        2. **Context API** (useContext):
          - For sharing state across components without prop drilling
          - Combined with useReducer for Redux-like patterns

        3. **Redux**:
          - Centralized store with actions and reducers
          - Uses useSelector and useDispatch hooks
          - Follows strict unidirectional data flow

        **Vue.js State Management:**

        Vue provides a more opinionated approach:

        1. **Composition API** (ref, reactive, computed):
          - ref() for primitive values
          - reactive() for objects
          - computed() for derived state

        2. **Pinia** (Official State Management):
          - Simpler API than Vuex
          - Stores defined with defineStore()
          - Built-in support for state, getters, and actions

        text: `Great question! Let me break down Docker and Kubernetes from your documentation:
        **Docker (Containerization)**

        Docker is the foundation for containerization:

        1. **Dockerfile** - Defines how to build your application image:
          - Base image selection (e.g., node:18-alpine)
          - Working directory setup
          - Dependency installation
          - Source code copying

        2. **Docker Compose** - Orchestrates multiple containers locally:
          - Defines services (app, db, redis)
          - Manages networking between containers
          - Handles volume persistence

        **Kubernetes (Container Orchestration)**

        Kubernetes manages containers at scale:

        1. **Deployments** - Define desired state:
          - Number of replicas
          - Container specifications
          - Resource limits (CPU, memory)

        2. **Services** - Expose applications:
          - LoadBalancer for external access
          - ClusterIP for internal communication

        3. **Ingress** - Route external traffic:
          - Host-based routing
          - Path-based routing

        **Workflow:**
        1. Development: Use Docker Compose locally
        2. Build: Create Docker images with CI/CD
        3. Push: Upload images to container registry
        4. Deploy: Kubernetes pulls images and manages pods
        5. Scale: Kubernetes handles replicas and load balancing

      {
        type: 'text',
        text: `Based on the Testing Strategies section in your documentation:
        **Unit Testing (with Jest)**

        Unit tests focus on individual functions or components in isolation:
        - Test single units of code (functions, classes, components)
        - Mock external dependencies
        - Fast execution, run frequently during development
        - Use describe blocks for grouping related tests
        - Use expect assertions with matchers like toBe, toEqual

        **Integration Testing**

        Integration tests verify that multiple components work together correctly:
        - Test API endpoints with tools like supertest
        - Verify request/response flow
        - Test database interactions
        - Check authentication and authorization flows
        - Validate that services communicate properly

        **E2E Testing (with Playwright)**

        End-to-end tests simulate real user behavior:
        - Test complete user flows through the application
        - Navigate pages with page.goto()
        - Interact with elements (fill forms, click buttons)
        - Assert on page state (URLs, content, visibility)
        - Run in real browser environments

        **Testing Pyramid:**
        - Many unit tests (fast, cheap)
        - Fewer integration tests (moderate speed)
        - Few E2E tests (slow, expensive)

        text: `Based on the Database Systems section of your documentation:
        **Relational Databases (SQL)**

        SQL databases like PostgreSQL use structured schemas:

        1. **Data Definition Language (DDL)**:
          - CREATE TABLE with columns, types, constraints
          - ALTER TABLE for schema modifications
          - DROP TABLE for removal

        2. **Data Manipulation (DML)**:
          - INSERT for adding records
          - UPDATE for modifications
          - DELETE for removal
          - SELECT with JOINs for querying

        3. **Advanced Features**:
          - Window functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK)
          - CTEs for complex queries
          - Indexing strategies (B-Tree, GIN, GiST)

        **NoSQL Databases**

        1. **Document Databases (MongoDB)**:
          - Flexible schemas with embedded documents
          - Aggregation pipelines
          - Good for variable structure data

        2. **Key-Value Stores (Redis)**:
          - Strings, Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, Hashes
          - Pub/Sub for real-time messaging
          - Great for caching

        3. **Graph Databases (Neo4j)**:
          - Nodes and relationships
          - Cypher query language
          - Best for connected data

        **When to Use:**
        - SQL: Structured data, complex queries, ACID transactions
        - NoSQL: Flexible schemas, high scalability, specific access patterns
