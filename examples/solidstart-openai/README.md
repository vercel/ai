# AI SDK, Solid.js, SolidStart and OpenAI Chat Example

This example shows how to use the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs) with [Solid](https://solidjs.com/), [SolidStart](https://start.solidjs.com), and [OpenAI](https://openai.com) to create a ChatGPT-like AI-powered streaming chat bot.

## Deploy your own

Deploy the example using [Vercel](https://vercel.com?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=ai-sdk-example):

## How to use

## Creating a project

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm init solid@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm init solid@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

Solid apps are built with _adapters_, which optimise your project for deployment to different environments.

By default, `npm run build` will generate a Node app that you can run with `npm start`. To use a different adapter, add it to the `devDependencies` in `package.json` and specify in your `vite.config.js`.
