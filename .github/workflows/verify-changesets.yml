# vercel/ai uses https://github.com/changesets/changesets for versioning and changelogs,
# but is not following semantic versioning. Instead, it uses `patch` for both fixes
# and features. It uses `minor` for "marketing releases", accompanied by a blog post and migration guide.
# This workflow verifies that all `.changeset/*.md` files use `patch` unless a `minor-release` label is present.
