feat(deepgram): add text-to-speech support

Add text-to-speech support for Deepgram Aura models via the REST API. Supports all Aura voice models (aura-2-helena-en, aura-2-thalia-en, etc.) with proper audio format validation, encoding/container/sample_rate/bitrate combinations, and comprehensive parameter validation.
