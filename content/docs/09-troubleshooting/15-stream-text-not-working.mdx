# `streamText` is not working

## Issue

I am using [`streamText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text) function, and it does not work.
It does not throw any errors and the stream is only containing error parts.

## Background

`streamText` immediately starts streaming to enable sending data without waiting for the model.
Errors become part of the stream and are not thrown to prevent e.g. servers from crashing.

## Solution

To log errors, you can provide an `onError` callback that is triggered when an error occurs.

```tsx highlight="6-8"
import { streamText } from 'ai';

const result = streamText({
  model: 'openai/gpt-4.1',
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
  onError({ error }) {
    console.error(error); // your error logging logic here
  },
});
```
