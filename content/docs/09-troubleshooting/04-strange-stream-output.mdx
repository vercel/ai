# useChat/useCompletion stream output contains 0:... instead of text

## Issue

I am using custom client code to process a server response that is sent using [`StreamingTextResponse`](/docs/reference/stream-helpers/streaming-text-response). I am using version `3.0.20` or newer of the AI SDK. When I send a query, the UI streams text such as `0: "Je"`, `0: " suis"`, `0: "des"...` instead of the text that Iâ€™m looking for.

## Background

The AI SDK has switched to the stream data protocol in version `3.0.20`. It sends different stream parts to support data, tool calls, etc. What you see is the raw stream data protocol response.

## Solution

You have several options:

1. Use the AI Core [`streamText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text) function to send a raw text stream:

   ```tsx
   export async function POST(req: Request) {
     const { prompt } = await req.json();

     const result = streamText({
       model: openai.completion('gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct'),
       maxTokens: 2000,
       prompt,
     });

     return result.toTextStreamResponse();
   }
   ```

2. Pin the AI SDK version to `3.0.19` . This will keep the raw text stream.
