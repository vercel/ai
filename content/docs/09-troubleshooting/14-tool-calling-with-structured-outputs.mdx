# Tool calling with generateObject and streamObject (structured outputs)

## Issue

You may want to combine tool calling with structured output generation. While `generateObject` and `streamObject` are designed specifically for structured outputs, they don't support tool calling.

## Background

To use tool calling with structured outputs, use `generateText` or `streamText` with the `output` option.

**Important**: When using `output` with tool calling, the structured output generation counts as an additional step in the execution flow.

## Solution

When using `output` with tool calling, adjust your `stopWhen` condition to account for the additional step required for structured output generation:

```tsx
const result = await generateText({
  model: __MODEL__,
  output: Output.object({
    schema: z.object({
      summary: z.string(),
      sentiment: z.enum(['positive', 'neutral', 'negative']),
    }),
  }),
  tools: {
    analyze: tool({
      description: 'Analyze data',
      inputSchema: z.object({
        data: z.string(),
      }),
      execute: async ({ data }) => {
        return { result: 'analyzed' };
      }),
    },
  },
  // Add at least 1 to your intended step count to account for structured output
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(3), // Now accounts for: tool call + tool result + structured output
  prompt: 'Analyze the data and provide a summary',
});
```
