# Streaming Not Working When Proxied

## Issue

Streaming with the AI SDK doesn't work in local development environment, or deployed in some proxy environments.
Instead of streaming, only the full response is returned after a while.

## Cause

The causes of this issue are caused by the proxy middleware.

If the middleware is configured to compress the response, it will cause the streaming to fail.

## Solution

You can try the following, the solution only affects the streaming API:

- add `'Content-Encoding': 'none'` headers

  ```tsx
  return result.toDataStreamResponse({
    headers: {
      'Content-Encoding': 'none',
    },
  });
  ```
