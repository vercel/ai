# Streaming Not Working in Production

## Issue

Streaming works in my local dev environment. I'm using the app router and I'm deploying to Vercel. However, streaming does not work in the deployed app. Instead of streaming, only the full response is returned after a while.

## Solution

Add the following to your route file:

```tsx
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'
```

This will enforce dynamic behavior, which is required for streaming.
