# Getting Timeouts When Deploying on Vercel

## Issue

Streaming with the AI SDK works in my local dev environment.
However, when I'm deploying to Vercel, longer responses get chopped off in the UI and I'm seeing timeouts in the Vercel logs.

## Solution

If you are using Next.js with the App Router, you can add the following to your route file:

```tsx
export const maxDuration = 60;
```

This increases the maximum duration of the function to 60 seconds.

For other frameworks such as Svelte, you can set timeouts in your `vercel.json` file:

```json
{
  "functions": {
    "api/chat/route.ts": {
      "maxDuration": 60
    }
  }
}
```
