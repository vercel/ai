# Streaming Not Working When Deploying on Vercel (Next.js Pages Router)

## Issue

I'm using the Next.js pages router. Streaming with the AI SDK works in my local development environment.
However, when deploying to Vercel, streaming does not work in the deployed app.
Instead of streaming, only the full response is returned after a while.

## Cause

The Next.js Pages Router currently does not support streaming with it's own routes.

## Solution

With Next.js 13+, you can mix and match App Router and Pages Router routes in the same project.
You need to use App Router routes for streaming with the AI SDK.

Example App Router route:

```tsx filename="app/api/chat/route.ts"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { StreamingTextResponse, streamText } from 'ai';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();

  const result = await streamText({
    model: openai('gpt-4-turbo'),
    messages,
  });

  return result.toAIStreamResponse();
}
```
