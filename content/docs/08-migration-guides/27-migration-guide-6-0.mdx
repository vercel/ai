# Migrate AI SDK 5.0 to 6.0 Beta

<Note type="warning">
  AI SDK 6 is currently in beta and introduces new capabilities like agents and
  tool approval. This guide will help you migrate from AI SDK 5.0 to 6.0 Beta.
  Note that you may want to wait until the stable release for production
  projects. See the [AI SDK 6 Beta announcement](/docs/announcing-ai-sdk-6-beta)
  for more details on what's new.
</Note>

## Recommended Migration Process

1. Backup your project. If you use a versioning control system, make sure all previous versions are committed.
1. Upgrade to AI SDK 6.0 Beta.
1. Follow the breaking changes guide below.
1. Verify your project is working as expected.
1. Commit your changes.

## AI SDK 6.0 Beta Package Versions

You need to update the following packages to the beta versions in your `package.json` file(s):

- `ai` package: `6.0.0-beta` (or use the `@beta` dist-tag)
- `@ai-sdk/provider` package: `3.0.0-beta` (or use the `@beta` dist-tag)
- `@ai-sdk/provider-utils` package: `4.0.0-beta` (or use the `@beta` dist-tag)
- `@ai-sdk/*` packages: `3.0.0-beta` (or use the `@beta` dist-tag for other `@ai-sdk` packages)

An example upgrade command would be:

```
pnpm install ai@beta @ai-sdk/react@beta @ai-sdk/openai@beta
```

## Codemods

The AI SDK **will** provide Codemod transformations to help upgrade your codebase when a
feature is deprecated, removed, or otherwise changed.

Codemods are transformations that run on your codebase automatically. They
allow you to easily apply many changes without having to manually go through
every file.

<Note>
  Codemods are intended as a tool to help you with the upgrade process. They may
  not cover all of the changes you need to make. You may need to make additional
  changes manually.
