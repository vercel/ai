# Migrate AI SDK 5.0 to 6.0

## Recommended Migration Process

1. Backup your project. If you use a versioning control system, make sure all previous versions are committed.
1. Upgrade to AI SDK 6.0.
1. Automatically migrate your code using one of these approaches:
   - Use the [AI SDK 6 Migration MCP Server](#ai-sdk-6-migration-mcp-server) for AI-assisted migration in Cursor or other MCP-compatible coding agents
   - Use [codemods](#codemods) to automatically transform your code
1. Follow the breaking changes guide below.
1. Verify your project is working as expected.
1. Commit your changes.

## AI SDK 6 Migration MCP Server

{/* TODO */}

The [AI SDK 6 Migration Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server](https://github.com/vercel-labs/ai-sdk-6-migration-mcp-server) provides an automated way to migrate your project using a coding agent. This server has been designed for Cursor, but should work with any coding agent that supports MCP.

To get started, create or edit `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ai-sdk-6-migration": {
      "url": "https://ai-sdk-6-migration-mcp-server.vercel.app/api/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

After saving, open the command palette (Cmd+Shift+P on macOS, Ctrl+Shift+P on Windows/Linux) and search for "View: Open MCP Settings". Verify the new server appears and is toggled on.

Then use this prompt:

```
Please migrate this project to AI SDK 6 using the ai-sdk-6-migration mcp server. Start by creating a checklist.
```

For more information, see the [AI SDK 6 Migration MCP Server repository](https://github.com/vercel-labs/ai-sdk-6-migration-mcp-server).

## AI SDK 6.0 Package Versions

You need to update the following packages to the following versions in your `package.json` file(s):

{/* TODO */}

- `ai` package: `6.0.0`
- `@ai-sdk/provider` package: `3.0.0`
- `@ai-sdk/provider-utils` package: `4.0.0`
- `@ai-sdk/*` packages: `3.0.0` (other `@ai-sdk` packages)

An example upgrade command would be:

```
pnpm install ai @ai-sdk/react @ai-sdk/openai
```

## Codemods

The AI SDK provides Codemod transformations to help upgrade your codebase when a
feature is deprecated, removed, or otherwise changed.

Codemods are transformations that run on your codebase automatically. They
allow you to easily apply many changes without having to manually go through
every file.

<Note>
  Codemods are intended as a tool to help you with the upgrade process. They may
  not cover all of the changes you need to make. You may need to make additional
  changes manually.
</Note>

You can run all codemods provided as part of the 6.0 upgrade process by running
the following command from the root of your project:

```sh
npx @ai-sdk/codemod upgrade
```

To run only the v6 codemods (v5 → v6 migration):

```sh
npx @ai-sdk/codemod v6
```

Individual codemods can be run by specifying the name of the codemod:

```sh
npx @ai-sdk/codemod <codemod-name> <path>
```

For example, to run a specific v6 codemod:

```sh
npx @ai-sdk/codemod v6/example-codemod src/
```

See also the [table of codemods](#codemod-table). In addition, the latest set of
codemods can be found in the
[`@ai-sdk/codemod`](https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/packages/codemod/src/codemods)
repository.
