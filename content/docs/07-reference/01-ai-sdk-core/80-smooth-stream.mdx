# `smoothStream()`

`smoothStream` is a utility function that creates a TransformStream
for the `streamText` `transform` option
to smooth out text streaming by buffering and releasing complete words with configurable delays.
This creates a more natural reading experience when streaming text responses.

```ts highlight={"6-9"}
import { smoothStream, streamText } from 'ai';

const result = streamText({
  model,
  prompt,
  experimental_transform: smoothStream({
    delayInMs: 20, // optional: defaults to 10ms
    chunking: 'line', // optional: defaults to 'word'
  }),
});
```

## Import

<Snippet text={`import { smoothStream } from "ai"`} prompt={false} />

## API Signature

### Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: 'delayInMs',
      type: 'number | null',
      isOptional: true,
      description:
        'The delay in milliseconds between outputting each chunk. Defaults to 10ms. Set to `null` to disable delays.',
    },
    {
      name: 'chunking',
      type: '"word" | "line" | RegExp | (buffer: string) => string | undefined | null',
      isOptional: true,
      description:
        'Controls how the text is chunked for streaming. Use "word" to stream word by word (default), "line" to stream line by line, or provide a custom callback or RegExp pattern for custom chunking.',
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Word chunking caveats with non-latin languages

<Note>
    The word based chunking **does not work well** with the following languages that do not delimit words with spaces:

    For these languages we recommend using a custom regex, like the following:

    - Chinese - `/[\u4E00-\u9FFF]|\S+\s+/`
    - Japanese - `/[\u3040-\u309F\u30A0-\u30FF]|\S+\s+/`

    For these languages you could pass your own language aware chunking function:

    - Vietnamese
    - Thai
    - Javanese (Aksara Jawa)

</Note>

#### Regex based chunking

To use regex based chunking, pass a `RegExp` to the `chunking` option.

```ts
// To split on underscores:
smoothStream({
  chunking: /_+/,
});

// Also can do it like this, same behavior
smoothStream({
  chunking: /[^_]*_/,
});
```

#### Custom callback chunking

To use a custom callback for chunking, pass a function to the `chunking` option.

```ts
smoothStream({
  chunking: text => {
    const findString = 'some string';
    const index = text.indexOf(findString);

    if (index === -1) {
      return null;
    }

    return text.slice(0, index) + findString;
  },
});
```

### Returns

Returns a `TransformStream` that:

- Buffers incoming text chunks
- Releases text when the chunking pattern is encountered
- Adds configurable delays between chunks for smooth output
- Passes through non-text chunks (like step-finish events) immediately
