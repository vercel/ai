# `useAIState`

<Note type="warning">
  AI SDK RSC is currently experimental. We recommend using [AI SDK
  UI](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/overview) for production. For guidance on migrating from
  RSC to UI, see our [migration guide](/docs/ai-sdk-rsc/migrating-to-ui).
</Note>

It is a hook that enables you to read and update the AI state. The AI state is shared globally between all `useAIState` hooks under the same `<AI/>` provider.

The AI state is intended to contain context and information shared with the AI model, such as system messages, function responses, and other relevant data.

## Import

<Snippet text={`import { useAIState } from "@ai-sdk/rsc"`} prompt={false} />

## API Signature

### Returns

A single element array where the first element is the current AI state.
