# Multi-Modal Chatbot

In this guide, you will build a multi-modal AI-chatbot with a streaming user interface.

Multi-modal refers to the ability of the chatbot to understand and generate responses in multiple formats, such as text, images, and videos. In this example, we will focus on sending images and generating text-based responses.

## Prerequisites

To follow this quickstart, you'll need:

- Node.js 18+ and pnpm installed on your local development machine.
- An OpenAI API key.

If you haven't obtained your OpenAI API key, you can do so by [signing up](https://platform.openai.com/signup/) on the OpenAI website.

## Create Your Application

Start by creating a new Next.js application. This command will create a new directory named `multi-modal-chatbot` and set up a basic Next.js application inside it.

<div className="mb-4">
  <Note>
    Be sure to select yes when prompted to use the App Router. If you are
    looking for the Next.js Pages Router quickstart guide, you can find it
    [here](/docs/getting-started/nextjs-pages-router).
  </Note>
</div>

<Snippet text="pnpm create next-app@latest multi-modal-chatbot" />

Navigate to the newly created directory:

<Snippet text="cd multi-modal-chatbot" />

### Install dependencies

Install `ai` and `@ai-sdk/openai`, the Vercel AI package and the AI SDK's [ OpenAI provider ](/providers/ai-sdk-providers/openai) respectively.

<Note>
  The AI SDK is designed to be a unified interface to interact with any large
  language model. This means that you can change model and providers with just
  one line of code! Learn more about [available providers](/providers) and
  [building custom providers](/providers/community-providers/custom-providers)
  in the [providers](/providers) section.
</Note>
<div className="my-4">
  <Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn']}>
    <Tab>
      <Snippet text="pnpm add ai @ai-sdk/openai" dark />
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      <Snippet text="npm install ai @ai-sdk/openai" dark />
    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      <Snippet text="yarn add ai @ai-sdk/openai" dark />
    </Tab>
  </Tabs>
</div>

<Note type="secondary" fill>
  Make sure you are using `ai` version 3.2.27 or higher.
</Note>

### Configure OpenAI API key

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root and add your OpenAI API Key. This key is used to authenticate your application with the OpenAI service.

<Snippet text="touch .env.local" />

Edit the `.env.local` file:

```env filename=".env.local"
OPENAI_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxx
```

Replace `xxxxxxxxx` with your actual OpenAI API key.

<Note className="mb-4">
  The AI SDK's OpenAI Provider will default to using the `OPENAI_API_KEY`
  environment variable.
</Note>

## Implementation Plan

To build a multi-modal chatbot, you will need to:

- Create a Route Handler to handle incoming chat messages and generate responses.
- Wire up the UI to display chat messages, provide a user input, and handle submitting new messages.
- Add the ability to upload images and attach them alongside the chat messages.

## Create a Route Handler

Create a route handler, `app/api/chat/route.ts` and add the following code:

```tsx filename="app/api/chat/route.ts"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { streamText } from 'ai';

// Allow streaming responses up to 30 seconds
export const maxDuration = 30;

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { messages } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: openai('gpt-4-turbo'),
    messages,
  });

  return result.toDataStreamResponse();
}
```

Let's take a look at what is happening in this code:

1. Define an asynchronous `POST` request handler and extract `messages` from the body of the request. The `messages` variable contains a history of the conversation between you and the chatbot and provides the chatbot with the necessary context to make the next generation.
2. Call [`streamText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text), which is imported from the `ai` package. This function accepts a configuration object that contains a `model` provider (imported from `@ai-sdk/openai`) and `messages` (defined in step 1). You can pass additional [settings](/docs/ai-sdk-core/settings) to further customise the model's behaviour.
3. The `streamText` function returns a [`StreamTextResult`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text#result-object). This result object contains the [ `toDataStreamResponse` ](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text#to-ai-stream-response) function which converts the result to a streamed response object.
4. Finally, return the result to the client to stream the response.

This Route Handler creates a POST request endpoint at `/api/chat`.

## Wire up the UI

Now that you have a Route Handler that can query a large language model (LLM), it's time to setup your frontend. [ AI SDK UI ](/docs/ai-sdk-ui) abstracts the complexity of a chat interface into one hook, [`useChat`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-ui/use-chat).

Update your root page (`app/page.tsx`) with the following code to show a list of chat messages and provide a user message input:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
'use client';

import { useChat } from 'ai/react';

export default function Chat() {
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat();
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col w-full max-w-md py-24 mx-auto stretch">
      {messages.map(m => (
        <div key={m.id} className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
          {m.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}
          {m.content}
        </div>
      ))}

      <form
        onSubmit={handleSubmit}
        className="fixed bottom-0 w-full max-w-md mb-8 border border-gray-300 rounded shadow-xl"
      >
        <input
          className="w-full p-2"
          value={input}
          placeholder="Say something..."
          onChange={handleInputChange}
        />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

<Note>
  Make sure you add the `"use client"` directive to the top of your file. This
  allows you to add interactivity with Javascript.
</Note>

This page utilizes the `useChat` hook, which will, by default, use the `POST` API route you created earlier (`/api/chat`). The hook provides functions and state for handling user input and form submission. The `useChat` hook provides multiple utility functions and state variables:

- `messages` - the current chat messages (an array of objects with `id`, `role`, and `content` properties).
- `input` - the current value of the user's input field.
- `handleInputChange` and `handleSubmit` - functions to handle user interactions (typing into the input field and submitting the form, respectively).
- `isLoading` - boolean that indicates whether the API request is in progress.

## Add Image Upload

To make your chatbot multi-modal, let's add the ability to upload and send images to the model. There are two ways to send attachments alongside a message with the `useChat` hook: by [ providing a `FileList` object ](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot#filelist) or a [ list of URLs ](/docs/ai-sdk-ui/chatbot#urls) to the `handleSubmit` function. In this guide, you will be using the `FileList` approach as it does not require any additional setup.

Update your root page (`app/page.tsx`) with the following code:

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx" highlight="4-5,10-11,19-33,39-49,51-61"
'use client';

import { useChat } from 'ai/react';
import { useRef, useState } from 'react';
import Image from 'next/image';

export default function Chat() {
  const { messages, input, handleInputChange, handleSubmit } = useChat();

  const [files, setFiles] = useState<FileList | undefined>(undefined);
  const fileInputRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col w-full max-w-md py-24 mx-auto stretch">
      {messages.map(m => (
        <div key={m.id} className="whitespace-pre-wrap">
          {m.role === 'user' ? 'User: ' : 'AI: '}
          {m.content}
          <div>
            {m?.experimental_attachments
              ?.filter(attachment =>
                attachment?.contentType?.startsWith('image/'),
              )
              .map((attachment, index) => (
                <Image
                  key={`${m.id}-${index}`}
                  src={attachment.url}
                  width={500}
                  height={500}
                  alt={attachment.name ?? `attachment-${index}`}
                />
              ))}
          </div>
        </div>
      ))}

      <form
        className="fixed bottom-0 w-full max-w-md p-2 mb-8 border border-gray-300 rounded shadow-xl space-y-2"
        onSubmit={event => {
          handleSubmit(event, {
            experimental_attachments: files,
          });

          setFiles(undefined);

          if (fileInputRef.current) {
            fileInputRef.current.value = '';
          }
        }}
      >
        <input
          type="file"
          className=""
          onChange={event => {
            if (event.target.files) {
              setFiles(event.target.files);
            }
          }}
          multiple
          ref={fileInputRef}
        />
        <input
          className="w-full p-2"
          value={input}
          placeholder="Say something..."
          onChange={handleInputChange}
        />
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this code, you:

1. Create state to hold the files and create a ref to the file input field.
2. Display the "uploaded" files in the UI.
3. Update the `onSubmit` function, to call the `handleSubmit` function manually, passing the the files as an option using the `experimental_attachments` key.
4. Add a file input field to the form, including an `onChange` handler to handle updating the files state.

## Running Your Application

With that, you have built everything you need for your multi-modal chatbot! To start your application, use the command:

<Snippet text="pnpm run dev" />

Head to your browser and open http://localhost:3000. You should see an input field and a button to upload an image.

Upload a file and ask the model to describe what it sees. Watch as the model's response is streamed back to you!

## Where to Next?
