# Smooth streaming chinese text

You can smooth stream chinese text by using the `smoothStream` function with `streamText`, and the following regex that splits either on words of chinese characters:

```tsx filename="page.tsx"
import { smoothStream, streamText } from 'ai';

const result = streamText({
  model: yourModel,
  prompt: 'Your prompt here',
  experimental_transform: smoothStream({
    chunking: /[\u4E00-\u9FFF]|\S+\s+/,
  }),
});
```
