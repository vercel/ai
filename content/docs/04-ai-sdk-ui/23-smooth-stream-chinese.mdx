# Smooth streaming chinese text

You can smooth stream chinese text by using the `smoothStream` function, and the following regex that splits either on words of chinese characters:

```tsx filename="page.tsx"
import { smoothStream } from 'ai';
import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';

const { data } = useChat({
  experimental_transform: smoothStream({
    chunking: /[\u4E00-\u9FFF]|\S+\s+/,
  }),
});
```
