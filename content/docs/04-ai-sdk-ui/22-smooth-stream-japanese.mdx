# Smooth streaming japanese text

You can smooth stream japanese text by using the `smoothStream` function, and the following regex that splits either on words of japanese characters:

```tsx filename="page.tsx"
import { smoothStream } from 'ai';
import { useChat } from '@ai-sdk/react';

const { data } = useChat({
  experimental_transform: smoothStream({
    chunking: /[\u3040-\u309F\u30A0-\u30FF]|\S+\s+/,
  }),
});
```
