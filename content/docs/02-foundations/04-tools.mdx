# Tools

While [large language models (LLMs)](/docs/foundations/overview#large-language-models) have incredible generation capabilities,
they struggle with discrete tasks (e.g. mathematics) and interacting with the outside world (e.g. getting the weather).

Tools are actions that an LLM can invoke.
The results of these actions can be reported back to the LLM to be considered in the next response.

For example, when you ask an LLM for the "weather in London", and there is a weather tool available, it could call a tool
with London as the argument. The tool would then fetch the weather data and return it to the LLM. The LLM can then use this
information in its response.

## What is a tool?

A tool is an object that can be called by the model to perform a specific task.
You can use tools with [`generateText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-text)
and [`streamText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text) by passing one or more tools to the `tools` parameter.

A tool consists of three properties:

- **`description`**: An optional description of the tool that can influence when the tool is picked.
- **`inputSchema`**: A [Zod schema](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/zod-schema) or a [JSON schema](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/json-schema) that defines the input required for the tool to run. The schema is consumed by the LLM, and also used to validate the LLM tool calls.
- **`execute`**: An optional async function that is called with the arguments from the tool call.

<Note>
  `streamUI` uses UI generator tools with a `generate` function that can return
  React components.
</Note>

If the LLM decides to use a tool, it will generate a tool call.
Tools with an `execute` function are run automatically when these calls are generated.
The output of the tool calls are returned using tool result objects.

You can automatically pass tool results back to the LLM
using [multi-step calls](/docs/ai-sdk-core/tools-and-tool-calling#multi-step-calls) with `streamText` and `generateText`.

## Schemas

Schemas are used to define and validate the [tool input](/docs/ai-sdk-core/tools-and-tool-calling), tools outputs, and structured output generation.

The AI SDK supports the following schemas:

- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) v3 and v4 directly or via [`zodSchema()`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/zod-schema)
- [Valibot](https://valibot.dev/) via [`valibotSchema()`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/valibot-schema) from `@ai-sdk/valibot`
- [Standard JSON Schema](https://standardschema.dev/json-schema) compatible schemas
- Raw JSON schemas via [`jsonSchema()`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/json-schema)

<Note>
  You can also use schemas for structured output generation with
  [`generateText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-text) and
  [`streamText`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-text) using the `output`
  setting.
</Note>

## Tool Packages

Given tools are JavaScript objects, they can be packaged and distributed through npm like any other library. This makes it easy to share reusable tools across projects and with the community.

### Using Ready-Made Tool Packages

Install a tool package and import the tools you need:

```bash
pnpm add some-tool-package
```

Then pass them directly to `generateText`, `streamText`, or your agent definition:

```ts highlight="2, 8"
import { generateText, stepCountIs } from 'ai';
import { searchTool } from 'some-tool-package';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: 'anthropic/claude-haiku-4.5',
  prompt: 'When was Vercel Ship AI?',
  tools: {
    webSearch: searchTool,
  },
  stopWhen: stepCountIs(10),
});
```

### Publishing Your Own Tools

You can publish your own tool packages to npm for others to use. Simply export your tool objects from your package:

```ts
// my-tools/index.ts
export const myTool = {
  description: 'A helpful tool',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    query: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ query }) => {
    // your tool logic
    return result;
  },
};
```

Anyone can then install and use your tools by importing them.

To get started, you can use the [AI SDK Tool Package Template](https://github.com/vercel-labs/ai-sdk-tool-as-package-template) which provides a ready-to-use starting point for publishing your own tools.

## Toolsets

When you work with tools, you typically need a mix of application-specific tools and general-purpose tools. The community has created various toolsets and resources to help you build and use tools.
