# Prompts

Prompts are instructions that you give a large language model (LLM) to tell it what to do.
It's like when you ask someone for directions; the clearer your question, the better the directions you'll get.

Many LLM providers offer complex interfaces for specifying prompts. They involve different roles and message types.
While these interfaces are powerful, they can be hard to use and understand.

The Vercel AI SDK simplifies prompting across compatible providers to text prompts or more elaborate message prompts.
Both prompt types support system messages, and message prompts can be multi-modal.

## Text Prompts

Text prompts are strings.
They are ideal for simple generation use cases,
e.g. repeatedly generating content for variants of the same prompt text.

You can set text prompts using the `prompt` property.
You can structure the text in any way and inject variables, e.g. using a template literal.

```ts highlight="3"
const result = await generateText({
  model,
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.'
})
```

You can also use template literals to provide dynamic data to your prompt.

```ts highlight="3-5"
const result = await generateText({
  model,
  prompt:
    `I am planning a trip to ${destination} for ${lengthOfStay} days. ` +
    `Please suggest the best tourist activities for me to do.`
})
```

## Message Prompts

A message prompt is an array of user, assistant, and tool messages.
They are great for chat interfaces and more complex, multi-modal prompts.

Each message has a `role` and a `content` property. The content can either be text (for user and assistant messages), or an array of relevant parts (data) for that message type.

```ts highlight="3-7"
const result = await generateText({
  model,
  messages: [
    { role: 'user', content: 'Hi!' },
    { role: 'assistant', content: 'Hello, how can I help?' },
    { role: 'user', content: 'Where can I buy the best Currywurst in Berlin?' }
  ]
})
```

<Note>
  Not all language models support all message and content types. For example,
  some models might not be capable of handling multi-modal inputs or tool
  messages. [Learn more about the capabilities of select
  models](./providers-and-models#model-capabilities).
</Note>

### Multi-modal messages

<Note>
  Multi-modal refers to interacting with a model across different data types
  (text, images, sound etc.).
</Note>

For models that support multi-modal inputs, user messages can include images. An `image` can be a base64-encoded image (`string`), an `ArrayBuffer`, a `Uint8Array`,
a `Buffer`, or a `URL` object. It is possible to mix text and multiple images.

```ts highlight="3-11"
const result = await generateText({
  model,
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        { type: 'text', text: 'Describe the image in detail.' },
        { type: 'image', image: fs.readFileSync('./data/comic-cat.png') }
      ]
    }
  ]
})
```

### Tool messages

<Note>
  Tools (also known as function calling) are programs that you can provide an
  LLM to extend it's built-in functionality. This can be anything from calling
  an external API to calling functions within your UI.
</Note>

For models that support [tool](/docs/ai-sdk-core/tools-and-tool-calling) calls, assistant messages can contain tool call parts, and tool messages can contain tool result parts.
A single assistant message can call multiple tools, and a single tool message can contain multiple tool results.

```ts highlight="3-43"
const result = await generateText({
  model,
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'text',
          text: 'How many calories are in this block of cheese?'
        },
        { type: 'image', image: fs.readFileSync('./data/roquefort.jpg') }
      ]
    },
    {
      role: 'assistant',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'tool-call',
          toolCallId: '12345',
          toolName: 'get-nutrition-data',
          args: { cheese: 'Roquefort' }
        }
        // there could be more tool calls here (parallel calling)
      ]
    },
    {
      role: 'tool',
      content: [
        {
          type: 'tool-result',
          toolCallId: '12345', // needs to match the tool call id
          toolName: 'get-nutrition-data',
          result: {
            name: 'Cheese, roquefort',
            calories: 369,
            fat: 31,
            protein: 22
          }
        }
        // there could be more tool results here (parallel calling)
      ]
    }
  ]
})
```

## System Messages

System messages are like character instructions that you would give an actor.
You can set system prompts using the `system` property.
System messages work with both the `prompt` and the `messages` properties.

```ts highlight="3-6"
const result = await generateText({
  model,
  system:
    `You help planning travel itineraries. ` +
    `Respond to the users' request with a list ` +
    `of the best stops to make in their destination.`,
  prompt:
    `I am planning a trip to ${destination} for ${lengthOfStay} days. ` +
    `Please suggest the best tourist activities for me to do.`
})
```
