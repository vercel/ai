# Provider Management

<Note>Provider management is an experimental feature.</Note>

When you work with multiple providers and models, it is often desirable to manage them in a central place
and access the models through simple string ids.

The Vercel AI SDK provides a [`ProviderRegistry`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/provider-registry) for this purpose.
You can register multiple providers. The provider id will become the prefix of the model id:
`providerId:modelId`.

### Setup (Example)

You can create a registry with multiple providers and models using `experimental_createProviderRegistry`.

<Note>
  It is common to keep the registry setup in a separate file and import it where
  needed.
</Note>

```ts filename={"registry.ts"}
import { anthropic } from '@ai-sdk/anthropic';
import { createOpenAI } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { experimental_createProviderRegistry as createProviderRegistry } from 'ai';

export const registry = createProviderRegistry({
  // register provider with prefix and default setup:
  anthropic,

  // register provider with prefix and custom setup:
  openai: createOpenAI({
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  }),
});
```

### Usage (Example)

You can access language models by using the `languageModel` method on the registry.
The provider id will become the prefix of the model id: `providerId:modelId`.

```ts highlight={"5"}
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { registry } from './registry';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: registry.languageModel('openai:gpt-4-turbo'),
  prompt: 'Invent a new holiday and describe its traditions.',
});
```
