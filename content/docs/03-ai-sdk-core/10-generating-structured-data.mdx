# Generating Structured Data

While text generation can be useful, your usecase will likely call for generating structured data.
For example, you might want to extract information from text, classify data, or generate synthetic data.

Many language models are capable of generating structured data, often defined as using "JSON modes" or "tools".
However, you need to manually provide schemas and then validate the generated data as LLMs can produce incorrect or incomplete structured data.

The Vercel AI SDK standardises structured object generation across model providers with the [`generateObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-object) function.

The `generateObject` function uses [Zod schemas](./schemas-and-zod) to specify the shape of the data that you want, and the AI model will generate data that conforms to that structure.
The schema is also used to validate the generated data, ensuring type safety and correctness.

```ts
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const { object } = await generateObject({
  model,
  schema: z.object({
    recipe: z.object({
      name: z.string(),
      ingredients: z.array(
        z.object({
          name: z.string(),
          amount: z.string(),
        }),
      ),
      steps: z.array(z.string()),
    }),
  }),
  prompt: 'Generate a lasagna recipe.',
});
```

## Specifying Generation Mode

While some models (like OpenAI) natively support object generation, others require alternative methods, like modified [tool calling](/docs/ai-sdk-core/tools-and-tool-calling). The `generateObject` function allows you to specify the method it will use to return structured data.

- `auto`: The provider will choose the best mode for the model.
- `tool`: A tool with the JSON schema as parameters is provided and the provider is instructed to use it.
- `json`: The JSON schema and an instruction is injected into the prompt. If the provider supports JSON mode, it is enabled.
- `grammar`: The provider is instructed to convert the JSON schema into a provider specific grammar and use it to select the output tokens.

<Note>Please note that most providers do not support all modes.</Note>

## Streaming Objects

Given the added complexity of returning structured data, model response time can be unacceptable for your interactive use case. With the [`streamObject`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/stream-object) function, you can stream the model's response as it is generated.

```ts
import { streamObject } from 'ai';

const { partialObjectStream } = await streamObject({
  // ...
});

// use partialObjectStream as an async iterable
for await (const partialObject of partialObjectStream) {
  console.log(partialObject);
}
```

You can also use `streamObject` to stream generated UIs in combination with React Server Components (see [Generative UI](../ai-sdk-rsc)).
