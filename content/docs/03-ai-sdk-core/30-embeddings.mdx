# Embeddings

Embeddings are a way to represent words, phrases, or images as vectors in a high-dimensional space.
In this space, similar words are close to each other, and the distance between words can be used to measure their similarity.

## Embedding a Single Value

The Vercel AI SDK provides the [`embed`](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/embed) function to embed single values, which is useful for tasks such as finding similar words
or phrases or clustering text.
You can use it with embeddings models, e.g. `openai.embedding('text-embedding-3-large')` or `mistral.embedding('mistral-embed')`.

```tsx
import { embed } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

// 'embedding' is a single embedding object (number[])
const { embedding } = await embed({
  model: openai.embedding('text-embedding-3-small'),
  value: 'sunny day at the beach',
});
```

## Embedding Many Values

When loading data, e.g. when preparing a data store for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
it is often useful to embed many values at once (batch embedding).

The Vercel AI SDK provides the `embedMany` function for this purpose.
Similar to `embed`, you can use it with embeddings models,
e.g. `openai.embedding('text-embedding-3-large')` or `mistral.embedding('mistral-embed')`.

```tsx
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { embedMany } from 'ai';

// 'embeddings' is an array of embedding objects (number[][]).
// It is sorted in the same order as the input values.
const { embeddings } = await embedMany({
  model: openai.embedding('text-embedding-3-small'),
  values: [
    'sunny day at the beach',
    'rainy afternoon in the city',
    'snowy night in the mountains',
  ],
});
```
