# Telemetry

<Note type="warning">
  AI SDK Telemetry is experimental and may change in the future.
</Note>

The AI SDK uses [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) to collect telemetry data.
OpenTelemetry is an open-source observability framework designed to provide
standardized instrumentation for collecting telemetry data.

Check out the [AI SDK Observability Integrations](/providers/observability)
to see providers that offer monitoring and tracing for AI SDK applications.

## Enabling telemetry

For Next.js applications, please follow the [Next.js OpenTelemetry guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/open-telemetry) to enable telemetry first.

You can then use the `experimental_telemetry` option to enable telemetry on specific function calls while the feature is experimental:

```ts highlight="4"
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4-turbo'),
  prompt: 'Write a short story about a cat.',
  experimental_telemetry: { isEnabled: true },
});
```

When telemetry is enabled, you can also control if you want to record the input values and the output values for the function.
By default, both are enabled. You can disable them by setting the `recordInputs` and `recordOutputs` options to `false`.

Disabling the recording of inputs and outputs can be useful for privacy, data transfer, and performance reasons.
You might for example want to disable recording inputs if they contain sensitive information.

## Telemetry Metadata

You can provide a `functionId` to identify the function that the telemetry data is for,
and `metadata` to include additional information in the telemetry data.

```ts highlight="6-10"
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4-turbo'),
  prompt: 'Write a short story about a cat.',
  experimental_telemetry: {
    isEnabled: true,
    functionId: 'my-awesome-function',
    metadata: {
      something: 'custom',
      someOtherThing: 'other-value',
    },
  },
});
```

## Custom Tracer

You may provide a `tracer` which must return an OpenTelemetry `Tracer`. This is useful in situations where
you want your traces to use a `TracerProvider` other than the one provided by the `@opentelemetry/api` singleton.

```ts highlight="7"
const tracerProvider = new NodeTracerProvider();
const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4-turbo'),
  prompt: 'Write a short story about a cat.',
  experimental_telemetry: {
    isEnabled: true,
    tracer: tracerProvider.getTracer('ai'),
  },
});
```
