# AI SDK

The AI SDK is the TypeScript toolkit designed to help developers build AI-powered applications with React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more.

## Why use the AI SDK?

Integrating large language models (LLMs) into applications is complicated and heavily dependent on the specific model provider you use.

- **[AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core):** A unified API for generating text, structured objects, and tool calls with LLMs.
- **[AI SDK UI](/docs/ai-sdk-ui):** A set of framework-agnostic hooks for quickly building chat and generative user interface.

## Model Providers

The AI SDK supports [multiple model providers](/providers).
