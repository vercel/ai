# AI SDK

The AI SDK is the TypeScript toolkit designed to help developers build AI-powered applications with React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, Node.js, and more.

## Why use the AI SDK?

Integrating large language models (LLMs) into applications is complicated and heavily dependent on the specific model provider you use.

- **[AI SDK Core](/docs/ai-sdk-core):** A unified API for generating text, structured objects, and tool calls with LLMs.
- **[AI SDK UI](/docs/ai-sdk-ui):** A set of framework-agnostic hooks for quickly building chat and generative user interface.

## Model Providers

The AI SDK supports [multiple model providers](/providers).

We've built some [templates](https://vercel.com/templates?type=ai) that include AI SDK integrations for different use cases, providers, and frameworks. You can use these templates to get started with your AI-powered application.

### Starter Kits

<Templates type="starter-kits" />

### Feature Exploration

### Frameworks

<Templates type="frameworks" />

### Generative UI

## Join our Community

If you have questions about anything related to the AI SDK, you're always welcome to ask our community on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/vercel/ai/discussions).

## `llms.txt`

You can access the entire AI SDK documentation in Markdown format at [sdk.vercel.ai/llms.txt](/llms.txt). This can be used to ask any LLM (assuming it has a big enough context window) questions about the AI SDK based on the most up-to-date documentation.

### Example Usage

For instance, to prompt an LLM with questions about the AI SDK:

1. Copy the documentation contents from [sdk.vercel.ai/llms.txt](/llms.txt)
2. Use the following prompt format:

```prompt
Documentation:
{paste documentation here}

Based on the above documentation, answer the following:
{your question}
```
