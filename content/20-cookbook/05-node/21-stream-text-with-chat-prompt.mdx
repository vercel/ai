# Stream Text with Chat Prompt

Text generation can sometimes take a long time to finish, especially when the response is big.
In such cases, it is useful to stream the chat completion to the client in real-time.
This allows the client to display the new message as it is being generated by the model,
rather than have users wait for it to finish.

```ts file='index.ts'
import { streamText } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const result = streamText({
  model: openai('gpt-3.5-turbo'),
  maxTokens: 1024,
  system: 'You are a helpful chatbot.',
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: 'Hello!',
    },
    {
      role: 'assistant',
      content: 'Hello! How can I help you today?',
    },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: 'I need help with my computer.',
    },
  ],
});

for await (const textPart of result.textStream) {
  console.log(textPart);
}
```
