# Call Tools in Multiple Steps

Models call tools to gather information or perform actions that are not directly available to the model.
When tool results are available, the model can use them to generate another response.

You can enable multi-step tool calls in `generateText` by setting the `maxSteps` option to
a number greater than 1.
This option specifies the maximum number of steps (i.e., LLM calls) that can be made to prevent infinite loops.

```ts highlight={"7"}
import { generateText, tool } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-4-turbo'),
  maxSteps: 5,
  tools: {
    weather: tool({
      description: 'Get the weather in a location',
      parameters: z.object({
        location: z.string().describe('The location to get the weather for'),
      }),
      execute: async ({ location }: { location: string }) => ({
        location,
        temperature: 72 + Math.floor(Math.random() * 21) - 10,
      }),
    }),
  },
  prompt: 'What is the weather in San Francisco?',
});
```
