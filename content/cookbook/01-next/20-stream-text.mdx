# Stream Text

Text generation can sometimes take a long time to complete, especially when you're generating a couple of paragraphs. In such cases, it is useful to stream the text generation process to the client in real-time. This allows the client to display the generated text as it is being generated, rather than have users wait for it to complete before displaying the result.

<Browser>
  <TextGeneration stream />
</Browser>

## Client

Let's create a simple React component that imports the `useCompletion` hook from the `@ai-sdk/react` module. The `useCompletion` hook will call the `/api/completion` endpoint when a button is clicked. The endpoint will generate text based on the input prompt and stream it to the client.

```tsx filename="app/page.tsx"
'use client';

import { useCompletion } from '@ai-sdk/react';

export default function Page() {
  const { completion, complete } = useCompletion({
    api: '/api/completion',
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <div
        onClick={async () => {
          await complete('Why is the sky blue?');
        }}
      >
        Generate
      </div>

      {completion}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Server

Let's create a route handler for `/api/completion` that will generate text based on the input prompt. The route will call the `streamText` function from the `ai` module, which will then generate text based on the input prompt and stream it to the client.

```typescript filename='app/api/completion/route.ts'
import { streamText } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

export async function POST(req: Request) {
  const { prompt }: { prompt: string } = await req.json();

  const result = streamText({
    model: openai('gpt-4'),
    system: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
    prompt,
  });

  return result.toUIMessageStreamResponse();
}
```
