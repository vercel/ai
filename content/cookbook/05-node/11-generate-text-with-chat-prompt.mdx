# Generate Text with Chat Prompt

Previously, we were able to generate text and objects using either a single message prompt, a system prompt, or a combination of both of them. However, there may be times when you want to generate text based on a series of messages.

A chat completion allows you to generate text based on a series of messages. This series of messages can be any series of interactions between any number of systems, but the most popular and relatable use case has been a series of messages that represent a conversation between a user and a model.

```ts file='index.ts'
import { generateText } from 'ai';
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';

const result = await generateText({
  model: openai('gpt-3.5-turbo'),
  maxTokens: 1024,
  system: 'You are a helpful chatbot.',
  messages: [
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: 'Hello!',
    },
    {
      role: 'assistant',
      content: 'Hello! How can I help you today?',
    },
    {
      role: 'user',
      content: 'I need help with my computer.',
    },
  ],
});

console.log(result.text);
```
