# Fal Provider

[Fal AI](https://fal.ai/) provides a generative media platform for developers with lightning-fast inference capabilities. Their platform offers optimized performance for running diffusion models, with speeds up to 4x faster than alternatives.

## Setup

The Fal provider is available via the `@ai-sdk/fal` module. You can install it with

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="pnpm add @ai-sdk/fal" dark />
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="npm install @ai-sdk/fal" dark />
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="yarn add @ai-sdk/fal" dark />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `fal` from `@ai-sdk/fal`:

```ts
import { fal } from '@ai-sdk/fal';
```

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createFal` and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createFal } from '@ai-sdk/fal';

const fal = createFal({
  apiKey: 'your-api-key', // optional, defaults to FAL_API_KEY environment variable
  baseURL: 'custom-url', // optional
  headers: {
    /* custom headers */
  }, // optional
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the Fal provider instance:

- **baseURL** _string_

  Use a different URL prefix for API calls, e.g. to use proxy servers.
  The default prefix is `https://fal.run`.

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being sent using the `Authorization` header.
  It defaults to the `FAL_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **headers** _Record&lt;string,string&gt;_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) => Promise&lt;Response&gt;_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.
  You can use it as a middleware to intercept requests,
  or to provide a custom fetch implementation for e.g. testing.

## Image Models

You can create Fal image models using the `.image()` factory method.
For more on image generation with the AI SDK see [generateImage()](/docs/reference/ai-sdk-core/generate-image).

### Basic Usage

```ts
import { fal } from '@ai-sdk/fal';
import { experimental_generateImage as generateImage } from 'ai';
import fs from 'fs';

const { image } = await generateImage({
  model: fal.image('fast-sdxl'),
  prompt: 'A serene mountain landscape at sunset',
});

const filename = `image-${Date.now()}.png`;
fs.writeFileSync(filename, image.uint8Array);
console.log(`Image saved to ${filename}`);
```

### Model Capabilities

Fal offers many models optimized for different use cases. Here are a few popular examples. For a full list of models, see the [Fal AI documentation](https://fal.ai/models).

| Model                        | Description                                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fast-sdxl`                  | High-speed SDXL model optimized for quick inference with up to 4x faster speeds        |
| `flux-pro/v1.1-ultra`        | Professional-grade image generation with up to 2K resolution and enhanced photorealism |
| `ideogram/v2`                | Specialized for high-quality posters and logos with exceptional typography handling    |
| `recraft-v3`                 | SOTA in image generation with vector art and brand style capabilities                  |
| `stable-diffusion-3.5-large` | Advanced MMDiT model with improved typography and complex prompt understanding         |
| `hyper-sdxl`                 | Performance-optimized SDXL variant with enhanced creative capabilities                 |

Fal models support the following aspect ratios:

- 1:1 (square HD)
- 16:9 (landscape)
- 9:16 (portrait)
- 4:3 (landscape)
- 3:4 (portrait)
- 16:10 (1280x800)
- 10:16 (800x1280)
