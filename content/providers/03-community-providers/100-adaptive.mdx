# Adaptive Provider

The [Adaptive provider](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers/adaptive) provides intelligent model selection and routing across multiple AI services for optimal performance and cost efficiency.

## Setup

The Adaptive provider is available in the `@adaptive-llm/adaptive` module. You can install it with

\<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}\>
\<Tab\>
\<Snippet text="pnpm add @adaptive-llm/adaptive" dark /\>
\</Tab\>
\<Tab\>
\<Snippet text="npm install @adaptive-llm/adaptive" dark /\>
\</Tab\>
\<Tab\>
\<Snippet text="yarn add @adaptive-llm/adaptive" dark /\>
\</Tab\>
\<Tab\>
\<Snippet text="bun add @adaptive-llm/adaptive" dark /\>
\</Tab\>
\</Tabs\>

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `adaptive` from `@adaptive-llm/adaptive`:

```ts
import { adaptive } from '@adaptive-llm/adaptive';
```

If you need a customized setup, you can import `createAdaptive` from `@adaptive-llm/adaptive`
and create a provider instance with your settings:

```ts
import { createAdaptive } from '@adaptive-llm/adaptive';

const adaptive = createAdaptive({
  // custom settings
});
```

You can use the following optional settings to customize the Adaptive provider instance:

- **baseURL** _string_

  Use a different URL prefix for API calls, e.g. to use proxy servers.
  The default prefix is `http://localhost:8080/v1`.

- **apiKey** _string_

  API key that is being sent using the `Authorization` header.
  It defaults to the `ADAPTIVE_API_KEY` environment variable.

- **headers** _Record\<string,string\>_

  Custom headers to include in the requests.

- **fetch** _(input: RequestInfo, init?: RequestInit) =\> Promise\<Response\>_

  Custom [fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/fetch) implementation.
  Defaults to the global `fetch` function.
  You can use it as a middleware to intercept requests,
  or to provide a custom fetch implementation for e.g. testing.

- **defaultProvider** _string_

  Default provider to use for comparisons and fallbacks.

## Language Models

You can create models that call the Adaptive API using a provider instance. The Adaptive provider automatically selects the best available underlying model based on your prompt and configured settings for optimal performance and cost efficiency.

```ts
const model = adaptive(); // Adaptive provider automatically selects the model
```

The Adaptive provider supports additional provider options:

```ts
const model = adaptive(); // Adaptive provider automatically selects the model

await generateText({
  model,
  providerOptions: {
    costBias: 0.8,
  },
});
```

The following optional provider options are available for Adaptive models:

- **costBias** _number_

  Bias towards cost-optimized selections (0-1, where 1 prioritizes cost).

### Example

You can use Adaptive language models to generate text with the `generateText` function:

```ts
import { adaptive } from '@adaptive-llm/adaptive';
import { generateText } from 'ai';

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: adaptive(), // Adaptive provider automatically selects the model
  prompt: 'Write a vegetarian lasagna recipe for 4 people.',
});
```

Adaptive language models can also be used in the `streamText`, `generateObject`, and `streamObject` functions
(see [AI SDK Core](https://www.google.com/search?q=/docs/ai-sdk-core)).

### Model Capabilities

The Adaptive provider automatically selects from available underlying providers and models, supporting:

- **Image Input**: Depends on selected underlying model
- **Object Generation**: Supported across most underlying models
- **Tool Usage**: Supported across most underlying models
- **Tool Streaming**: Supported across most underlying models

The specific capabilities depend on which underlying model is selected by the Adaptive routing system.

## Text Embedding Models

Text embedding is not currently supported by the Adaptive provider.
