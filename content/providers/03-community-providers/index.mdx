# Community Providers

The Vercel AI SDK provides a [Language Model Specification](https://github.com/vercel/ai/tree/main/packages/provider/src/language-model/v1).
You can [write your own provider](./community-providers/custom-providers) that adheres to the specification and it will be compatible with the AI SDK.

There is currently one community provider that has been created using the Language Model Specification:

<CommunityModelCards />
