# Vivgrid

[Vivgrid](https://vivgrid.com) is an enterprise-grade AI development platform designed to streamline agent development and deployment. Built on the open-source [YoMo](https://github.com/yomorun/yomo) framework, Vivgrid combines managed AI services with a globally distributed infrastructure to deliver production-ready AI applications.

## Key Features

### üöÄ Zero-Configuration Model Management

Unlike traditional providers that require explicit model selection in code, Vivgrid manages your AI models and system prompts through a centralized console. This allows for dynamic model switching and prompt optimization without code changes.

### ‚ö° Serverless MCP

Deploy your LLM function tools as Serverless MCP with one click. This architecture eliminates DevOps overhead while providing automatic scaling and global distribution.

### üõ†Ô∏è Type-Safe Function Calling

Write LLM tools in TypeScript with full type safety. Functions are decoupled from your main application, enabling easier testing, debugging, and maintenance.

### üåç Global AI Inference Infrastructure

Vivgrid's geo-distributed infrastructure leverages QUIC protocol for low-latency connections across 50+ regions. Requests are automatically routed to the nearest region for optimal performance.

### üìä Enterprise Observability

Comprehensive monitoring includes latency breakdown analysis, cost tracking, and performance optimization tools. Built-in regression testing ensures consistent model performance over time.

## Installation

Install the Vivgrid provider package:

<Tabs items={['pnpm', 'npm', 'yarn']}>
  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="pnpm add @vivgrid/ai-sdk-provider" dark />
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="npm install @vivgrid/ai-sdk-provider" dark />
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    <Snippet text="yarn add @vivgrid/ai-sdk-provider" dark />
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## API Key Setup

Configure your Vivgrid API key as an environment variable:

```bash
# Unix/Linux/macOS
export VIVGRID_API_KEY=your-api-key

# Windows Command Prompt
set VIVGRID_API_KEY=your-api-key

# Windows PowerShell
$env:VIVGRID_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

Obtain your API key from the [Vivgrid Console](https://console.vivgrid.com).

## Provider Instance

You can import the default provider instance `vivgrid` from `@vivgrid/ai-sdk-provider`:

```typescript
import { createVivgrid } from "@vivgrid/ai-sdk-provider";

const vivgrid = createVivgrid({
  apiKey: process.env.VIVGRID_API_KEY,
});
```

## Language Models

Vivgrid's unique approach to model management allows you to configure models through the [Console](https://console.vivgrid.com) rather than hardcoding them in your application:

```typescript
// Using console-managed model configuration
const model = vivgrid.model('managed');

// Or specify a model directly if needed
const model = vivgrid.model('gpt-4');
```

This approach enables:

- **Dynamic model switching** without code change and redeployments
- **A/B testing** different models in production
- **Centralized prompt management** across your organization, collaborate with your team

Available models are documented in the [Vivgrid Models Reference](https://docs.vivgrid.com/models).

## Examples

### generateText

```javascript
import { vivgrid } from "@vivgrid/ai-sdk-provider";
import { generateText } from "ai";

const { text } = await generateText({
  model: vivgrid(), // Uses console-managed model and system prompt
  prompt: "Write a vegetable lasagna recipe for 4 people",
});

console.log(text);
```

### Streaming Text Generation

```typescript
import { vivgrid } from "@vivgrid/ai-sdk-provider";
import { streamText } from "ai";

const { textStream } = await streamText({
  model: vivgrid(),
  prompt: "Tell me a story about a brave little rabbit",
});

for await (const textPart of textStream) {
  process.stdout.write(textPart);
}
```

### Serverless MCP

Tools (LLM Function Calling) can be written in TypeScript with strongly-typed language support. They are decoupled from the main codebase and reduce management overhead through a serverless architecture. Additionally, all tools are automatically served as MCP ervers.

Here's how to implement a `get-weather` tool:

```typescript
const description = "Get the current weather for `city_name`";

export type Argument = {
  /**
   * The name of the city to query weather for
   */
  city_name: string;
}

export async function handler(args: Argument) {
  const result = await getWeather(args.city_name);
  return result;
}
```

Then [deploy it to Vivgrid](https://docs.vivgrid.com/function-calling), and use it in your code like this:

```typescript
import { vivgrid } from "@vivgrid/ai-sdk-provider";
import { generateText } from "ai";

const { text, toolCalls } = await generateText({
  model: vivgrid(),
  prompt: "What's the weather like in San Francisco?",
  /* No need to define tools locally anymore */
  // tools: {
  //   weather: {
  //     description: "Get weather for a specified location",
  //     parameters: z.object({
  //       location: z.string().describe("City name"),
  //     }),
  //     execute: async ({ location }) => {
  //       // Actual weather API call
  //       return `The weather in ${location} is sunny, 22¬∞C`;
  //     },
  //   },
  // },
});
```

## Advanced Capabilities

Vivgrid offers powerful features designed to give developers granular control and deep insights into their applications:

- **Cost Management**: Monitor and optimize your expenditures with detailed usage analytics available directly in the Vivgrid console.

- **Latency Analysis**: Gain full visibility into performance bottlenecks. Vivgrid meticulously logs the duration of every operation, from Model API requests to individual tool function calls, enabling precise performance tuning.

- **Flexible Model Integration**: Seamlessly switch between leading models, including those from OpenAI, Gemini, and Claude, without modifying your existing codebase.

- **Regression Testing**: Ensure the continued reliability of your agents. Vivgrid integrates with [Alchemist](https://alchemist.vivgrid.com), a dedicated tool for comprehensive regression testing of your models, system prompts, and tools.

- **Cross-Provider Compatibility**: Write once, deploy anywhere. Maintain a consistent code structure across various model providers, simplifying development and migration.
