# Provider Development Notes

## Provider Options Schemas

Provider options schemas are user facing.
We want them to be as restrictive as possible, so that we have more flexibility with future changes and allow for meaningful `null` values.

- use `.optional()` unless `null` is meaningful

## Response Schemas

Response schemas need to be flexible enough to deal with provider API changes that do not affect our processing
to prevent unnecessary breakages.

- keep them minimal (no unused properties)
- use `.nullish()` instead of `.optional()`
