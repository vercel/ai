Reason why a language model finished generating a response.

Can be one of the following:
- `stop`: model generated stop sequence
- `length`: model generated maximum number of tokens
- `content-filter`: content filter violation stopped the model
- `tool-calls`: model triggered tool calls
- `error`: model stopped because of an error
- `other`: model stopped for other reasons
- `unknown`: the model has not transmitted a finish reason
