 * Additional provider-specific options.

 * that can be fully encapsulated in the provider.

 * This enables us to quickly ship provider-specific functionality
 * without affecting the core AI SDK.
 *
 * The outer record is keyed by the provider name, and the inner
 * record is keyed by the provider-specific metadata key.
