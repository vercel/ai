import { experimental_transcribe as transcribe } from 'ai';

const { text } = await transcribe({
  model: deepgram.transcription('nova-3'),
  audio: new URL(
    'https://github.com/vercel/ai/raw/refs/heads/main/examples/ai-core/data/galileo.mp3',
  ),
});
```

### Transcription with Language Detection

```ts
import { deepgram } from '@ai-sdk/deepgram';
import { experimental_transcribe as transcribe } from 'ai';

const { text, language } = await transcribe({
  model: deepgram.transcription('nova-3'),
  audio: new URL(
    'https://github.com/vercel/ai/raw/refs/heads/main/examples/ai-core/data/galileo.mp3',
