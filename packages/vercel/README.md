# AI SDK - Vercel Provider

The **[Vercel provider](https://ai-sdk.dev/providers/ai-sdk-providers/vercel)** for the [AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs)
gives you access to the v0 API, designed for building modern web applications. The `v0-1.0-md` model supports text and image inputs, provides fast streaming responses, and is compatible with the OpenAI Chat Completions API format.

Key features include:

- Framework aware completions: Optimized for modern stacks like Next.js and Vercel
- Auto-fix: Identifies and corrects common coding issues during generation
- Quick edit: Streams inline edits as they're available
- Multimodal: Supports both text and image inputs
