In [Scandinavia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavia), the culture was succeeded by the [Kongemose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kongemose_culture) culture.\nThe name originates from the [Danish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark) archeological site Maglemose, situated near [Gørlev](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gørlev) and [Høng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Høng) on western [Zealand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zealand_(Denmark)), southwest of lake [Tissø](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissø). Here the first settlement of the culture was excavated in 1900, by George Sarauw.[[1]](./Maglemosian_culture#cite_note-1) During the following century a long series of similar settlements were excavated from [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England) to [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland) and from [Skåne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skåne) in [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden) to northern [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France).\nWhen the Maglemosian culture flourished, sea levels were much lower than now and what is now mainland Europe and Scandinavia were linked with Britain. The cultural period overlaps the end of the [last ice age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weichselian_glaciation),[[2]](./Maglemosian_culture#cite_note-2) when the ice retreated and the glaciers melted. It was a long process and sea levels in [Northern Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Europe) did not reach current levels until almost 6000 BC, by which time they had inundated large territories previously inhabited by Maglemosian people. Therefore, there is hope that the emerging discipline of [underwater archaeology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_archaeology) may reveal interesting findings related to the Maglemosian culture in the future.\nThe Maglemosian people lived in forest and wetland environments, using fishing and hunting tools made from wood, bone, and flint [microliths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microlith). It appears that they had domesticated the [dog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog).[[3]](./Maglemosian_culture#cite_note-3) Some may have lived settled lives, but most were nomadic.[[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)]\nHuts made of bark have been preserved, in addition to tools made of [flint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint), [bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone), and [horn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_(anatomy)). A characteristic feature of the culture is the sharply edged [microliths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microlith) of flintstone, used for spear and arrow heads.[[4]](./Maglemosian_culture#cite_note-4) Another notable feature is the [leister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leister), a characteristic type of fishing spear, used for [gigging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gigging).\nEra | Timespan |\n|\n---|\n![]() |\nThis section needs expansion.
