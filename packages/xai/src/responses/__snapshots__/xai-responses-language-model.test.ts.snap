    "text": "### What People Are Saying About AI on X (as of Late October 2025)

Based on recent posts on X (formerly Twitter), discussions about AI are buzzing with a mix of excitement, technical deep dives, and cautious optimism. The conversation heavily revolves around **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** as the holy grail of AI development, with frequent references to a new paper from AI luminaries like Yoshua Bengio, Eric Schmidt, Gary Marcus, and Max Tegmark. People are debating definitions, progress, limitations, and real-world applications. Here's a breakdown of the main themes from the top relevant posts (focusing on the last month):

#### 1. **Defining AGI and Its Distance from Current AI**
   - A huge focus is on clarifying what AGI really means. Multiple users cite the aforementioned paper, which defines AGI as an AI system that "matches or exceeds the cognitive versatility and proficiency of a well-educated adult" across 10 core cognitive areas (e.g., reasoning, memory, math, language, perception).
     - Example: @jiqizhixin shared the paper, noting that models like GPT-4 and GPT-5 score poorly (e.g., 0% on long-term memory), emphasizing AGI isn't here yet.
     - @alex_prompter broke it down simply: GPT-4 is at 27% toward AGI, GPT-5 at 58%, but gaps in continuous learning persist. They called it a "clear benchmark" without hype.
     - @AskPerplexity and @flowersslop echoed this, describing AGI as broadly adaptable like humans, not just narrow tools like today's chatbots.
   - ASI (Artificial Superintelligence) gets mentioned as the next step beyond AGI—AI surpassing humans in *all* domains, including creativity and strategy. @SciTechera tied it to the "Singularity," where AI self-improves uncontrollably.
   - Skepticism: @Newaxeman called AI an "advanced search engine" aggregating conventional wisdom, questioning deeper intelligence claims.

#### 2. **Progress and Timelines Toward AGI**
   - Optimism is high but grounded. @bindureddy (CEO of Abacus.AI) boldly predicted AGI (AI replacing humans in digital tasks) is "just a couple of years away," citing missing pieces like context, tools, and self-awareness that labs are tackling.
   - @slow_developer referenced OpenAI and DeepMind's 5-level AGI framework: Current models are past Level 2 (emerging intelligence) and into early Level 3 (competent in complex tasks with supervision), but not fully autonomous yet.
   - @timmur_ stressed AGI requires efficient learning across open-ended tasks with minimal data—something no model achieves today, but "we will solve it eventually."
   - Broader view: @FrnkNlsn recommended the book *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach* by Russell and Norvig for a comprehensive overview, highlighting topics like knowledge representation and multi-agent systems.

#### 3. **Types of AI and Distinctions**
   - Users are educating on AI's varieties to cut through confusion:
     - @y00ngipurrs differentiated analytical AI (e.g., for medicine, fraud detection) from generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT for text/art).
     - @techyoutbe contrasted AI agents (task-specific automators) with "agentic AI" (autonomous systems for long-term planning and multi-domain reasoning).
     - @SukhSandhu listed what AI *is* (data processor, pattern recognizer, task automator) vs. what it's *not* (conscious, emotional, intuitively moral). They warned of biases in training data.
   - @AITECHio hyped proactive "AI agents" that set goals and execute workflows autonomously, predicting one for every task from finance to on-chain automation.

#### 4. **Applications, Projects, and Broader Impacts**
   - AI's practical side shines in Web3 and business contexts. @O_H_JAY highlighted crypto projects advancing AGI/ASI, like @SentientAGI (decentralized AGI networks), @AGI_XT (AI automation on Solana), and @StoryProtocol (on-chain IP for AI models). They urged getting in early during market dips.
   - @Voa_De_Voa discussed combining AI with compute and robotics for "autonomous intelligence," but flagged centralized control as a risk.
   - @DeviprasadSD positioned AGI as a future horizon for reasoning across any task, still in research.
   - @zolayolanetwork and @davilagrau amplified the AGI definition paper, linking it to blockchain and cognitive tools.

#### Overall Sentiment
- **Positive/Visionary**: Excitement about AI augmenting human capabilities (e.g., @hailstorm_9 called AGI "augmentation, not automation"). Many see it transforming industries like healthcare, finance, and creative work.
- **Cautious/Realistic**: Emphasis on limitations—current AI is "narrow" and lacks true understanding or adaptability. No one's claiming AGI is imminent without caveats.
- **Volume and Engagement**: These posts garnered thousands of likes/views, with high engagement on definitions and project lists. Discussions are technical but accessible, often with images, threads, or links to papers/arXiv.

This is a snapshot from ~20 recent, highly relevant posts. AI chatter on X is evolving fast—trends like AGI benchmarks and agentic systems are dominating. If you want deeper dives into specific posts, users, or subtopics (e.g., AI ethics or tools), let me know!",

    "delta": "### Overview of Sonoran Cuisine
Sonoran cuisine originates from the state of Sonora in northwest Mexico, blending indigenous, Spanish, and American influences due to its proximity to the U.S. border and arid desert environment. It's notably rustic, flavorful, and fusion-oriented, often featuring grilled meats, fresh produce, and bold spices adapted to the region's hot, dry climate. Unlike coastal Mexican cuisines, it emphasizes hearty, protein-heavy dishes with influences from the American Southwest, such as flour tortillas and cheese.

### Key Ingredients and Techniques
- **Meats and Proteins**: Grilled or roasted meats like beef (carne asada), pork, and chicken are central, often seasoned with simple marinades of lime, garlic, and chili. Machaca (dried, shredded beef) is a hallmark preservation technique for the desert.
- **Chiles and Spices**: Local chiles (e.g., Sonora's chiltepin, a tiny, potent pepper) add heat, while cumin, oregano, and cilantro provide earthy flavors. Beans (frijoles) and corn are staples, often prepared simply to highlight natural tastes.
- **Tortillas and Breads**: Flour tortillas dominate, reflecting American influence, unlike corn tortillas in many other Mexican regions. Baking and grilling are common, with an emphasis on fresh, unprocessed ingredients.
- **Regional Staples**: Desert elements like nopales (cactus pads), nopalitos, and wild herbs are incorporated for texture and nutrition, showcasing indigenous roots.

### Signature Dishes
- **Carne Asada Tacos**: Thinly sliced, grilled skirt steak served on flour tortillas with salsa, onions, and cilantro—often eaten with beans and rice.
- **Sonoran Hot Dogs**: A fusion dish where a hot dog is wrapped in bacon, grilled, and topped with pinto beans, onions, tomatoes, mayo, mustard, and cheese in a sliced bolillo roll. This originated in border towns and highlights Mexican-American crossover.
- **Chimichangas**: Deep-fried burritos filled with meat, cheese, and beans, served with guacamole and sour cream—a nod to Tex-Mex influences.
- **Ceviche and Seafood**: Coastal Sonoran areas feature fresh ceviche (citrus-marinated fish) and shrimp dishes, contrasting the land-based inland cuisine.
- **Other Notables**: Guaymas-style tamales (with meat and sauce) and caldillo (a beef stew with potatoes) emphasize slow-cooked comfort foods.

### Cultural and Historical Influences
Sonora's style emerged from indigenous Yaqui and Mayo tribes, who used desert foraging, combined with Spanish colonial methods like cattle ranching. Post-Mexican-American War migration boosted American elements, creating dishes like flour-based tacos. Today, it's celebrated in cities like Hermosillo and Tucson (Arizona), influencing Southwestern U.S. cuisine. Festivals like the Sonora International Gastronomic Festival highlight its evolution, and it's known for its focus on quality ingredients over elaborate preparations, making it accessible and flavorful for everyday meals. If you're exploring, local markets (tianguis) are the best places to experience authentic flavors.",

    "delta": "### Overview of Sonoran Cuisine
Sonoran cuisine originates from the Sonora region in northwestern Mexico, characterized by its simplicity, fresh ingredients, and emphasis on grilling and bold flavors. Unlike spicier Mexican cuisines from other regions, it's notably milder, relying on the region's abundant desert produce and livestock. This style blends indigenous influences (e.g., from Yaqui and Mayo peoples) with Spanish colonial elements, resulting in hearty, straightforward dishes that highlight natural tastes over complex preparations.

### Key Ingredients and Flavors
- **Mild Chilies and Heat**: The signature is the Mexican Sonora chile (a mild, fruity pepper), often used fresh or roasted. Unlike hotter varieties in Yucatán or Oaxaca, Sonoran food avoids excessive spice, focusing on subtle sweetness and smokiness.
- **Desert and Local Produce**: Staples include nopales (cactus pads), beans, corn, tomatoes, and onions. The arid climate favors grilled or fresh preparations, with minimal sauces.
- **Proteins**: Beef, especially in carne asada (grilled skirt steak), is dominant, reflecting Sonora's cattle ranching history. Other meats like pork or chicken are common, often seasoned simply with garlic, lime, and herbs.
- **Influence of the Sea and Land**: Coastal areas incorporate seafood (e.g., shrimp or fish), while inland focuses on ranch-raised meats. Dairy is rare, emphasizing Mexican crema or cheese sparingly.

### Notable Dishes and Preparation Styles
- **Grilling as a Core Technique**: Many dishes are cooked over open flames or on a comal, imparting a charred, smoky flavor. This is seen in carne asada, served with tortillas, guacamole, and pico de gallo.
- **Iconic Foods**: 
  - **Machaca**: Shredded, dried beef slow-cooked with eggs, onions, and chilies— a breakfast staple that's simple yet flavorful.
  - **Tamales**: Steamed corn masa filled with meat or cheese, often wrapped in corn husks; Sonoran versions are less sauced than those in central Mexico.
  - **Chimichangas**: Fried burritos, a Sonora-influenced Tex-Mex creation, highlighting the region's border proximity to Arizona.
- **Beverages**: Agua fresca (fruit waters) from local fruits like watermelon or hibiscus, and horchata, a rice-based drink, complement meals.

### Cultural and Regional Context
Sonoran's style is practical for its hot, dry climate—dishes are quick to prepare and preserve well. It's less ornate than Yucatecan or Jaliscan cuisines, prioritizing sustenance over elaboration. In the U.S., especially Arizona, Sonoran influences appear in fusion foods like Mexican hot dogs (bacon-wrapped with beans and salsa). This cuisine's notable restraint in spice and focus on grilling make it distinct, emphasizing the desert's bounty for authentic, approachable meals.",

    "delta": "### Overview of Sonoran Cuisine
Sonoran food originates from the Sonoran Desert region, spanning parts of northern Mexico (especially Sonora state) and southern Arizona. It's a rustic, resourceful style shaped by the arid environment, blending Indigenous, Spanish, and Mexican influences. Unlike the more complex, mole-heavy cuisines of central Mexico, Sonoran fare emphasizes simplicity, fresh local ingredients, and bold, smoky flavors from grilling and chiles. It's practical for desert living, focusing on sustenance with minimal processing.

### Key Ingredients and Characteristics
- **Local Produce and Staples**: Heavily reliant on desert-sourced items like nopales (prickly pear cactus pads), which are grilled or sautéed for their tangy, crisp texture. Beans (pinto or black), corn, and chiles (e.g., chili pequin or jalapeños) are ubiquitous, often used fresh or dried. Tomatoes, onions, and herbs like cilantro add freshness.
- **Proteins**: Beef, pork, and chicken dominate, with grilling (asado) as a core technique, infusing meats with smoky char. Seafood appears in coastal Sonoran areas, like shrimp or fish tacos.
- **Bold Flavors and Simplicity**: Dishes avoid heavy sauces; instead, they rely on spices, lime, and chiles for heat and acidity. Tortillas (corn or flour) serve as the base, with minimal elaboration—think of it as "desert pragmatism" where food is hearty yet straightforward to prepare in hot climates.

### Signature Dishes
- **Carne Asada**: Grilled skirt or flank steak marinated in lime, garlic, and cumin, served with tortillas, salsa, and beans. It's the region's barbecue staple, often enjoyed at family gatherings.
- **Sonoran Hot Dogs**: A fusion delight where a bacon-wrapped hot dog is topped with pinto beans, salsa, onions, and mustard in a bun. Originating in Hermosillo, Mexico, it's a street food icon, blending American and Mexican influences.
- **Tacos and Tamales**: Tacos are filled with grilled meats, nopales, or cheese, while tamales use corn masa wrapped in corn husks and steamed, often stuffed with pork or chicken.
- **Chimichangas**: Deep-fried burritos, more associated with Arizona's Mexican-American adaptations, filled with meat, cheese, and beans.

### Cultural and Regional Notes
Sonoran cuisine reflects Indigenous roots from tribes like the Tohono O'odham and Yaqui, who taught Europeans to use desert plants for survival. Spanish colonialists added wheat flour and livestock. In Mexico's Sonora, it's more traditional and seafood-influenced near the Gulf of California, while in Arizona, it incorporates Tex-Mex elements like flour tortillas and cheese. This style stands out for its resilience and adaptability, making it distinct from coastal Mexican seafood or Yucatecan spice profiles. For authentic experiences, try spots like food trucks in Tucson or markets in Hermosillo.",

    "delta": "xAI is an American artificial intelligence company founded by Elon Musk in July 2023. Its mission is to "understand the true nature of the universe" by advancing scientific discovery through AI. The company is based in the San Francisco Bay Area and focuses on developing advanced AI models, including the Grok chatbot (integrated with the X platform, formerly Twitter).

Key points:
- **Founders and Team**: Led by Elon Musk, with a team of engineers and researchers from companies like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Tesla.
- **Products**: xAI has released Grok-1 (an open-source large language model) and subsequent versions like Grok-1.5 and Grok-2, which power conversational AI tools.
- **Funding**: Raised significant venture capital, including a $6 billion Series B round in 2024, valuing the company at around $24 billion.
- **Philosophy**: Emphasizes curiosity-driven AI development, with a focus on truth-seeking and avoiding overly restrictive safety measures compared to competitors.

Note: "XAI" can also refer to "Explainable AI," a field in machine learning that makes AI decisions transparent and interpretable to humans. If that's what you meant, let me know for more details! For the latest updates, check x.ai.",
