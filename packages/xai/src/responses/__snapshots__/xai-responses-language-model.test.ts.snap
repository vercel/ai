    "text": "### What People Are Saying About AI on X (as of Late October 2025)

Based on recent posts on X (formerly Twitter), discussions about AI are buzzing with a mix of excitement, technical deep dives, and cautious optimism. The conversation heavily revolves around **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** as the holy grail of AI development, with frequent references to a new paper from AI luminaries like Yoshua Bengio, Eric Schmidt, Gary Marcus, and Max Tegmark. People are debating definitions, progress, limitations, and real-world applications. Here's a breakdown of the main themes from the top relevant posts (focusing on the last month):

#### 1. **Defining AGI and Its Distance from Current AI**
   - A huge focus is on clarifying what AGI really means. Multiple users cite the aforementioned paper, which defines AGI as an AI system that "matches or exceeds the cognitive versatility and proficiency of a well-educated adult" across 10 core cognitive areas (e.g., reasoning, memory, math, language, perception).
     - Example: @jiqizhixin shared the paper, noting that models like GPT-4 and GPT-5 score poorly (e.g., 0% on long-term memory), emphasizing AGI isn't here yet.
     - @alex_prompter broke it down simply: GPT-4 is at 27% toward AGI, GPT-5 at 58%, but gaps in continuous learning persist. They called it a "clear benchmark" without hype.
     - @AskPerplexity and @flowersslop echoed this, describing AGI as broadly adaptable like humans, not just narrow tools like today's chatbots.
   - ASI (Artificial Superintelligence) gets mentioned as the next step beyond AGI—AI surpassing humans in *all* domains, including creativity and strategy. @SciTechera tied it to the "Singularity," where AI self-improves uncontrollably.
   - Skepticism: @Newaxeman called AI an "advanced search engine" aggregating conventional wisdom, questioning deeper intelligence claims.

#### 2. **Progress and Timelines Toward AGI**
   - Optimism is high but grounded. @bindureddy (CEO of Abacus.AI) boldly predicted AGI (AI replacing humans in digital tasks) is "just a couple of years away," citing missing pieces like context, tools, and self-awareness that labs are tackling.
   - @slow_developer referenced OpenAI and DeepMind's 5-level AGI framework: Current models are past Level 2 (emerging intelligence) and into early Level 3 (competent in complex tasks with supervision), but not fully autonomous yet.
   - @timmur_ stressed AGI requires efficient learning across open-ended tasks with minimal data—something no model achieves today, but "we will solve it eventually."
   - Broader view: @FrnkNlsn recommended the book *Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach* by Russell and Norvig for a comprehensive overview, highlighting topics like knowledge representation and multi-agent systems.

#### 3. **Types of AI and Distinctions**
   - Users are educating on AI's varieties to cut through confusion:
     - @y00ngipurrs differentiated analytical AI (e.g., for medicine, fraud detection) from generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT for text/art).
     - @techyoutbe contrasted AI agents (task-specific automators) with "agentic AI" (autonomous systems for long-term planning and multi-domain reasoning).
     - @SukhSandhu listed what AI *is* (data processor, pattern recognizer, task automator) vs. what it's *not* (conscious, emotional, intuitively moral). They warned of biases in training data.
   - @AITECHio hyped proactive "AI agents" that set goals and execute workflows autonomously, predicting one for every task from finance to on-chain automation.

#### 4. **Applications, Projects, and Broader Impacts**
   - AI's practical side shines in Web3 and business contexts. @O_H_JAY highlighted crypto projects advancing AGI/ASI, like @SentientAGI (decentralized AGI networks), @AGI_XT (AI automation on Solana), and @StoryProtocol (on-chain IP for AI models). They urged getting in early during market dips.
   - @Voa_De_Voa discussed combining AI with compute and robotics for "autonomous intelligence," but flagged centralized control as a risk.
   - @DeviprasadSD positioned AGI as a future horizon for reasoning across any task, still in research.
   - @zolayolanetwork and @davilagrau amplified the AGI definition paper, linking it to blockchain and cognitive tools.

#### Overall Sentiment
- **Positive/Visionary**: Excitement about AI augmenting human capabilities (e.g., @hailstorm_9 called AGI "augmentation, not automation"). Many see it transforming industries like healthcare, finance, and creative work.
- **Cautious/Realistic**: Emphasis on limitations—current AI is "narrow" and lacks true understanding or adaptability. No one's claiming AGI is imminent without caveats.
- **Volume and Engagement**: These posts garnered thousands of likes/views, with high engagement on definitions and project lists. Discussions are technical but accessible, often with images, threads, or links to papers/arXiv.

This is a snapshot from ~20 recent, highly relevant posts. AI chatter on X is evolving fast—trends like AGI benchmarks and agentic systems are dominating. If you want deeper dives into specific posts, users, or subtopics (e.g., AI ethics or tools), let me know!",

    "delta": "### Overview of Sonoran Cuisine
Sonoran cuisine originates from the state of Sonora in northwest Mexico, blending indigenous, Spanish, and American influences due to its proximity to the U.S. border and arid desert environment. It's notably rustic, flavorful, and fusion-oriented, often featuring grilled meats, fresh produce, and bold spices adapted to the region's hot, dry climate. Unlike coastal Mexican cuisines, it emphasizes hearty, protein-heavy dishes with influences from the American Southwest, such as flour tortillas and cheese.

### Key Ingredients and Techniques
- **Meats and Proteins**: Grilled or roasted meats like beef (carne asada), pork, and chicken are central, often seasoned with simple marinades of lime, garlic, and chili. Machaca (dried, shredded beef) is a hallmark preservation technique for the desert.
- **Chiles and Spices**: Local chiles (e.g., Sonora's chiltepin, a tiny, potent pepper) add heat, while cumin, oregano, and cilantro provide earthy flavors. Beans (frijoles) and corn are staples, often prepared simply to highlight natural tastes.
- **Tortillas and Breads**: Flour tortillas dominate, reflecting American influence, unlike corn tortillas in many other Mexican regions. Baking and grilling are common, with an emphasis on fresh, unprocessed ingredients.
- **Regional Staples**: Desert elements like nopales (cactus pads), nopalitos, and wild herbs are incorporated for texture and nutrition, showcasing indigenous roots.

### Signature Dishes
- **Carne Asada Tacos**: Thinly sliced, grilled skirt steak served on flour tortillas with salsa, onions, and cilantro—often eaten with beans and rice.
- **Sonoran Hot Dogs**: A fusion dish where a hot dog is wrapped in bacon, grilled, and topped with pinto beans, onions, tomatoes, mayo, mustard, and cheese in a sliced bolillo roll. This originated in border towns and highlights Mexican-American crossover.
- **Chimichangas**: Deep-fried burritos filled with meat, cheese, and beans, served with guacamole and sour cream—a nod to Tex-Mex influences.
- **Ceviche and Seafood**: Coastal Sonoran areas feature fresh ceviche (citrus-marinated fish) and shrimp dishes, contrasting the land-based inland cuisine.
- **Other Notables**: Guaymas-style tamales (with meat and sauce) and caldillo (a beef stew with potatoes) emphasize slow-cooked comfort foods.

### Cultural and Historical Influences
Sonora's style emerged from indigenous Yaqui and Mayo tribes, who used desert foraging, combined with Spanish colonial methods like cattle ranching. Post-Mexican-American War migration boosted American elements, creating dishes like flour-based tacos. Today, it's celebrated in cities like Hermosillo and Tucson (Arizona), influencing Southwestern U.S. cuisine. Festivals like the Sonora International Gastronomic Festival highlight its evolution, and it's known for its focus on quality ingredients over elaborate preparations, making it accessible and flavorful for everyday meals. If you're exploring, local markets (tianguis) are the best places to experience authentic flavors.",

    "delta": "xAI is an American artificial intelligence company founded by Elon Musk in July 2023. Its mission is to "understand the true nature of the universe" by advancing scientific discovery through AI. The company is based in the San Francisco Bay Area and focuses on developing advanced AI models, including the Grok chatbot (integrated with the X platform, formerly Twitter).

Key points:
- **Founders and Team**: Led by Elon Musk, with a team of engineers and researchers from companies like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Tesla.
- **Products**: xAI has released Grok-1 (an open-source large language model) and subsequent versions like Grok-1.5 and Grok-2, which power conversational AI tools.
- **Funding**: Raised significant venture capital, including a $6 billion Series B round in 2024, valuing the company at around $24 billion.
- **Philosophy**: Emphasizes curiosity-driven AI development, with a focus on truth-seeking and avoiding overly restrictive safety measures compared to competitors.

Note: "XAI" can also refer to "Explainable AI," a field in machine learning that makes AI decisions transparent and interpretable to humans. If that's what you meant, let me know for more details! For the latest updates, check x.ai.",
