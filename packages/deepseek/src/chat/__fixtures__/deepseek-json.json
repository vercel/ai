The assistant's response should be the JSON output. So I should output exactly that JSON? Or perhaps wrap it in some way? The instruction says \"Reply with JSON object ONLY.\" Probably I should output the result as is, or maybe a structured response. But the tool result is already JSON. I think I should output that JSON directly. However, I need to ensure it's a valid response. Let me output the JSON object."
