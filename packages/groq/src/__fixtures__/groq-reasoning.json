        "content": "The word \"strawberry\" contains **3** instances of the letter **R**. \n\nHere's the breakdown:\n- **S** T **R** A W B E **R** **R** Y\n\nThe letter \"R\" appears at the 3rd, 8th, and 9th positions. \n\n**Answer:** 3.",
        "reasoning": "Okay, so the user is asking how many times the letter \"r\" appears in the word \"strawberry.\" Let me start by breaking down the word into its individual letters. Let me spell it out: S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. Strawberry is spelled S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. So let's write each letter with its position to make sure.\n\n1. S\n2. T\n3. R\n4. A\n5. W\n6. B\n7. E\n8. R\n9. R\n10. Y\n\nWait, is that 10 letters? Let me count again. S (1), T (2), R (3), A (4), W (5), B (6), E (7), R (8), R (9), Y (10). Yeah, that's 10 letters in total. Now, let's look for the letter \"R.\" The third letter is R, then the eighth and ninth letters are both R. So positions 3, 8, and 9. That's three R's. Wait, but I need to confirm each time. Let me go through the letters again:\n\n1. S – not R\n2. T – not R\n3. R – first R\n4. A – no\n5. W – no\n6. B – no\n7. E – no\n8. R – second R\n9. R – third R\n10. Y – no\n\nSo that's three times. Let me check once more to be certain. Sometimes people can miscount. The word \"strawberry\" is S-T-R-A-W-B-E-R-R-Y. Breaking it down by syllables might help. Strawberry has two syllables: straw-berry. But maybe splitting the word isn't necessary. Alternatively, writing out the word and underlining each R. Let me try that.\n\nS T R A W B E R R Y\n\nUnderlining the R's: the third letter, the eighth, and ninth letters. So three R's. Wait, is there an R in there that I missed? Let me check again:\n\nPosition 1: S\n\n2: T\n\n3: R\n\n4: A\n\n5: W\n\n6: B\n\n7: E\n\n8: R\n\n9: R\n\n10: Y\n\nYes, positions 3, 8, and 9. So three R's total. I think that's correct. Sometimes when letters are next to each other, like the two R's at the end, people might count them as one, but they're separate letters. So the answer should be 3.\n"
